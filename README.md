# RGB Visualisation Web App

A responsive web application that visualises the red, green, and blue components of an image. Users can toggle between different colour channels (Red, Green, Blue) to see how each contributes to the overall image. It also supports **fullscreen mode** with an intuitive UI optimised for both desktop and mobile screens.

## Features

- **Colour Channel Toggle:** Easily toggle the visibility of red, green, and blue colour channels.
- **Responsive Design:** Automatically adapts to various screen sizes and devices, with optimised mobile support.
- **Fullscreen Mode:** View the application in fullscreen mode with a dedicated fullscreen button.
- **Mix-Blend Mode:** Layers use blend modes for an authentic RGB visualisation.
- **Visible Colour Bars:** At full colour, this section shows white (made of red + green + blue), yellow (red + green), cyan (green + blue), green, magenta (red + blue), red, blue and black (absence of colour/light). Users can see how these colours change when certain colour channels are toggled off and on.
